> Don't guess. Logify.

### We design different ideas into a single code.

## ðŸ’¡ About LogifyLabs

LogifyLabs is an expert community dedicated to researching the **Logify methodology**â€”a process of transforming real-world problems into code through philosophical argument.

<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?

This space is for all product teams (planners, developers, designers) who want to end draining debates and rework, and build successful products based on logic instead of gut feelings.

<br>

## ðŸš€ How to Participate?

1.  **Read our Methodology:** First, read our [the-logify-methodology](link-to-repo) repository, which contains our philosophy. You can see how we turn 'guesswork' into 'certainty'.
2.  **Join the Discussion:** Please participate in the discussions happening in the `Issues` tab. Your experiences, pains, and ideas make Logify stronger.
